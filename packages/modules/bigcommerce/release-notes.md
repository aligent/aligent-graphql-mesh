# BigCommerce GraphQl Module Release Notes

## bigcommerce-graphql-module-1.0.2

### Overview of changes

There are TS errors being thrown by the product data that is using the types from `dist/packages/generated/bigcommerce-operations/`
The BC SF GraphQL API is being used to dynamically generate the TS. This is causing issues since the types should be based off the actual GraphQL operation and not just off the schema for the API.

The orders resolver is being patched to return only orders that are for that customer.
